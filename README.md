## Overview

An open-source scalar package and associated software tools have been
developed in the Scala programming language, including plotting tools
based on the free GRACE plotting package. The scalar package represents
physical scalars and can help to prevent errors involving physical units
in engineering and scientific computation. The scalar package includes a
complete implementation of the standard SI metric system of units and
many common non-metric units. The design also allows users to easily
define a specialized or reduced set of physical units for any particular
application or domain. The scalar package can be used in two different
modes: one mode provides unit compatibility checking but is slower, and
the other mode bypasses the compatibility checks but is much faster and
still prevents the most common type of unit error. Switching between the
two modes requires no changes in the user's code, making it convenient
and usable with no significant performance penalty for even the most
computationally intensive applications.
